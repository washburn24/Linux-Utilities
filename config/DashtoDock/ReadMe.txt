Around the time of Gnome 46, DashtoDock seemingly started taking control of more visual parameters, which seemed to then defeat some changes made in gnome-shell.css while also seeming to add (maybe double count) some icon padding resulting in a "shrunk" dock that was suddenly no longer quite as shrunk.  So, this file is edited with some settings at the end that remove some of that default padding, intentionally put at the end so it's easy to respect extension updates instead of locking down the file in general.  Also, because I don't know all the side effects of brute forcing parameters, this is implemented only in the dock situation I care about (dock on right, shrink enabled).

These extra parameters should be appended to stylesheet.css in the DashtoDock install location, commonly ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/dash-to-dock@micxgx.gmail.com/ (scroll to the bottom for the last dozen or so lines).  I keep the full version of the previous stylesheet.css for easy diffing when a new version is released, but the intention is for everything except the appended bits to be default.
